Turns on and off a (LED) connected to a digital  pin, without using the delay() function.  This means that other code can run at the same time without being interrupted by the LED code.
The circuit: LED attached from pin 13 (P5.0) to ground.
const int ledPin =  13;  // constants won't change. Used here to set pin number of the LED pin
// Variables will change:
int ledState = LOW;             // ledState used to set the LED
long previousMillis = 0;        // will store last time LED was updated
// the follow variables is a long because the time, measured in miliseconds,  will quickly become a bigger number than can be stored in an int.
long interval = 1000;           // interval at which to blink (milliseconds)
void setup() {
pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);      // set the digital pin as output:
}
void loop()
{
// here is where you'd put code that needs to be running all the time. check to see if it's time to blink the LED; that is, if the difference between the current time and last time you blinked the LED is bigger than the interval at which you want to  blink the LED.
unsigned long currentMillis = millis();
if(currentMillis - previousMillis > interval) {
previousMillis = currentMillis;   // save the last time you blinked the LED 
if (ledState == LOW)      // if the LED is off turn it on and vice-versa:
ledState = HIGH;
else
ledState = LOW;
digitalWrite(ledPin, ledState);     // set the LED with the ledState of the variable:
} 
}

Aim: Turns on an LED on for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly.
Hardware required: MSP432 TI launchpad
//see pins_energia.h for more LED definitions
#define LED GREEN_LED                        // you can also use #define LED RED_LED
// the setup routine runs once when you press reset:
void setup() {                
pinMode(LED, OUTPUT);                      // initialize the digital pin as an output.
}
// the loop routine runs over and over again forever:
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED, HIGH);                    // turn the LED on by making the voltage HIGH
  delay(1000);                                        // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(LED, LOW);                   // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);                                       // wait for a second
}

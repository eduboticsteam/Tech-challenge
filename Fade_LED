  This example shows how to fade an LED on pin 14 using the analogWrite() function.

int brightness = 0;    		           // how bright the LED is
int fadeAmount = 5;                                 // how many points to fade the LED by
void setup()  { 
pinMode(GREEN_LED, OUTPUT);      // declare pin 14 to be an output:
} 
void loop()  { 
analogWrite(GREEN_LED, brightness);  // set the brightness of pin 9:  
brightness = brightness + fadeAmount;
if (brightness == 0 || brightness == 255) {  // reverse the direction of the fading at the ends of the fade:
fadeAmount = -fadeAmount ; 
}     
delay(30);                            	  // wait for 30 milliseconds to see the dimming effect    
}
